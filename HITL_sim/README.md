## HITL simulation

The Hardware in the loop (**HITL**) simulation is aimed at testing the communication between the OpenMV Camera H7P and the pixhawk flight controller.  

#Hardware setup

The hardware we used is:
  - [OpenMV Camera H7 Plus](https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7-plus) for running the main code script managing the drone navigation
      and the landing pad alignment routines;
  - [Pixhawk4 mini](http://www.holybro.com/product/pixhawk4-mini/) is the flight controller with witch the OpenMV Camera communicates via MAVLink protocol 
  in order to control the drone.
